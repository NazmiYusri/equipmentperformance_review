## Project Title
Equipment Performance Monitoring Dashboard – Mining & Construction Sector 

## Project Goal
To design an interactive Equipment Performance Dashboard using Power BI that enables operational teams to monitor usage trends, downtime patterns, and maintenance activities across a fleet of heavy machinery.
The dashboard aims to provide real-time insights to identify underperforming equipment, optimize maintenance scheduling, improve overall utilization rates, and support data-driven decision making for operational efficiency improvements.

## Tools Used
Power BI, Excel (for data simulation)

## Data Overview
•	1,000 records simulated for different equipment types over a 2-month period.
•	Fields: Usage Hours, Downtime Hours, Maintenance Hours, Equipment Type, Date.

## Key KPIs and Metrics
•	Average Utilization Rate
•	Total Downtime Hours
•	Total Maintainance Hours
•	Average Usage Hours

## The Output Result


## Business Impact
This dashboard enables early detection of performance issues, helps plan preventive maintenance, and improves equipment ROI through data-driven operational strategies.
